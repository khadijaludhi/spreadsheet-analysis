## Project Description
The "Spreadsheet Analysis" project entails creating a Python script to read and analyze sales data from a CSV file. The script performs several key functions:
- Reads data from the spreadsheet.
- Collects monthly sales data into a list.
- Outputs the total, average, and identifies the highest and lowest sales months.
- Calculates monthly changes as a percentage.
- Writes a summary of the results to a new spreadsheet.

## Running the Project
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system and the `sales.csv` file is in the same directory as the script. Use the following command:
```bash
python spreadsheet_analysis.py
